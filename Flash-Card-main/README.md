# Flash-Card
Welcome to the Spanish Flash-Card project, a delightful and efficient way to expand your Spanish vocabulary! This project is designed to help you learn the most frequent 1000 Spanish words from Wikipedia through interactive flash-cards.

## Features:

1. **Interactive Learning:** Our flash-cards present you with a Spanish word to learn. If you know the word and its English transcription, simply click on the tick button to proceed to the next word.

2. **Limited Time:** To challenge yourself and encourage quick recall, you have only 3 seconds to reveal the correct answer by clicking the tick button. Don't worry; it's all about fun learning!

3. **Progressive Learning:** As you continue using the flash-cards, words you successfully identify will be removed from the list of words to be shown again. This ensures you focus on the words that need more practice.

## How to Use:

1. **Starting the Flash-Cards:** Launch the application and start your Spanish learning journey.

2. **Learning Process:** Each flash-card displays a Spanish word, and you have a limited time to click the tick button if you know the word and its English transcription.

## Acknowledgments:

I would like to include that the most frequent 1000 Spanish words used in this project were gotten from Wikipedia, making this learning tool precise and accurate.
